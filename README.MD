# Kotlin Workshop for Java Developers
  

## Summary
This is a repository with examples and exercises for a Kotlin workshop designed for Java developers.
It has showcases for basic Kotlin features, and tasks in JUnit format.  

## Prerequisites
- Java knowledge
- IntelliJ IDEA installed
- gradle downloaded / configured in IntelliJ IDEA (should be automatic when you clone)

## Check if all works

- in IntelliJ IDEA -> new -> project from version control -> paste https://github.com/glowienko/kotlin-basics-workshop.git
- go to CheckIfThisRunsFirstIfYesYouAreGoodToGo file
- run existing test, it should pass

## How to run the exercises

test package is the starting point. <br> 
Open eg. Exercise_1_NullabilityHandling.kt file - it contains a test class. <br>
Run test methods like you would normally do with Junit5. 

**Add missing implementation and make all the tests pass! <br>**
